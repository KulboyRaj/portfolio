    var details = ["ðŸ˜ƒ I am proud to announce that I secured the 3rd position at the prestigious e-Yantra Robotics Competition (Swatchhta Bot ðŸ¤– ) organized by IITB ðŸ˜Š. I spent countless hours coding, designing, and building robots, and I learned so much in the process. The competition challenged me to think outside the box, solve problems, and collaborate effectively with my team member.The theme was to make line following bot which travels across the arena, which is abstraction of smart-city. City has different city-blocks with some kind of garbage. Bot is supposed to sense and classify the garbage and dump it in respective dumping yard out of city. The bot finds optimal path using dijkstra's algorithm and communicate with laptop using zigbee.ðŸ¤– There were two phases to the competition, first stage was simulation-based, where I had to design and implement our robot's software using Verilog and simulation tools. Once we were satisfied with our simulation results, and making sure it was functioning as intended, we moved on to the second stage, which was actual hardware-based. We had to implement our design on an FPGA board and test our robot's functionality in real-life scenarios. This involved debugging and optimizing our design to ensure that it could operate reliably in various scenarios. It was a fantastic accomplishment to be chosen as one of the top 4 teams for the championship game at IITB.", "This is a smart security robot which is made using Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, laser sensor, motor driver and pir sensor. This bot is moving in the home without colliding to any obstacle using ultrasonic sensor. Pir help that bot for detection of any movement happening, after movement detection the servo motor and another ultrasonic sensor help to find the closest person position in his 180 degree of freedom then servo motor points towards that position and leaser sensor fires on that suspect in this way the bot works.", "I am glad to say that I invented smart stick for blind people. The project name is 'Third Eye'. There are over 18 million visually impaired people only in India and over 2.2 billion in the entire world. These all people have eyes but not vision. There is no solution for to put vision in their eyes.I used raspberry pi, webcam, battery as hardware and python, deep learning, machine learning, OpenCV as software using this device blind person can hear, what are the objects present infront of him/her.It also have voice assitant system so person can interact with the stick to get the current time and his location using GPS . It means now blind person can also see using his third eye.The main vision behind this development is, blind person is also a same person like us and he/she also have right to live same as other people #deeplearning #machinelearning #opencv #project #blind #visuallyimpaired #india #raspberrypi", "As we know for safety purpose we are using camera then also we can't avoid robbery because we don't have a real time solution which can detect the robbery and take security actions so I developed this smart security camera which can able to capture the image of suspect and send to the administrator email and also able to make a phone call to administrator then administrator can replay to the same email by just simple yes or no, If replay is 'no' then is it's not a suspect the system runs smoothly again but if the replay is 'yes' then suddenly alarm start and even the location of the strong room send to the nearest police station and in this way we can able to stop the robbery in real time.
